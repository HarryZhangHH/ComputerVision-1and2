You need the following libraries to work with the code:
    + Numpy
    + Opencv
    + Matplotlib
Other image manipulation libraries are not allowed. These libraries are
guaranteed to be installed on the TAs machines.

The main entry point is ConvertColourSpace.py. Fill in the blank functions
in the file rgbConversions.py and visualize.py. Add the appropriate call
under the main function of ConvertColourSpace.py to validate your assignment.

We will run the file ConvertColourSpace.py. Please include the different
sections as commented subsections so that we can run it by switching them on
and off.

Although you shouldn't need any other libraries, in the off-chance you do end
up using additional libraries, please include clear instructions with your code
submission about how to install the library and run the code appropriately.
Similarly, if you do end up modifying the structure of the code, please include
clear instructions on how to run your code. We won't be debugging your code
beyond, maybe missing file path. Code that fails to run, will be graded
accordingly.
